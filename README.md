# SecAIWorkshop_Spring25

**SecureAI** is a cybersecurity and privacy training program designed for AI professionals
and researchers to equip them with the knowledge and skills to build AI systems that are sound
and secure.

Each workshop has a lab component, where participants will get hands-on experience
with AI models, allowing them to apply the concepts provided in pre-recorded lectures/talks and self-study materials
of each workshop. This github repo will house the material and code needed to run the experiments
for the SecureAI workshops.
